# [ABOUT ME](./about.html)

Currently I have survived five years of booming of all kinds of exams with respect to biology, chemistry, and clinical training. However, my academic interests go beyond the superfical techniques that save people's lives physically, but on subjects regarding the nature of humans, the social science field such like sociology and economics. 

Besides that, I'm also curious about recent technical advances that may reshape the relationship between diseases and human beings. Machine learning, or broadly speaking, AI, has been widely used to change our life's boundaries. AI may indicate something magic, but it is well explained in math and clearly represented in models. In clinical research, bioinformatics armed with big data processing are improving our knowledge about the mechanisms of diseases and patients' behavior. I'm totally attracted by the picture it depicts and decide to learn about it in my master program.

I worked on a social network analysis project when I was a senior undergraduate student.For more detail, you could visit [this page](./sna.html).
