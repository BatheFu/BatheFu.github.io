# [ABOUT ME](./about.html)

Currently I have survived three years of booming of all kinds of exams with respect to biology, chemistry, and clinical training. Unfortunately, my academic interests go beyond the surfical techniques that could save people's lives physically, but on subjects regarding the nature of humans. This mostly points to some social science fields like sociology and economics. 

Besides that, I'm also indulged in most popular trends now that may reshape the future of social sciences, which is machine learning, broadly speaking, AI.(As we know, this word has been widely used to indicate something magic, but in fact it has restricted applications in the real life.)

# My Current Working Projects

For the last ten months, I have looked quite carefully into the medical forum DingXiangYuan(DXY).

This is a professional website for doctors, researchers, and medical students to share their knowledge, as well as to develop a supportive community in their life and work.  

Click [here](http://bbs.dxy.cn)  to visit the forum's homepage.

With the help of a friend for the data collecting by scraping the pages of the members discussion, we analyzed the interaction patterns since 2002(the website's initial year) using social network analysis. Here shows one image that smoothens the life span of the users.

As we see in the picture, most members are active for less than one year, while some of them could keep active with the development of the forum. They are key members in the forum who knows the history of this community, not only serve as the information distributors, but also administrators, and gate keepers to lead more people engage in discussions. These leaders do not take the role of all above all the time, therefore, it's crucial to find out how these alternations of leaders happen as the time goes on, and how does it relates to the rigor of  the forum.

However, I'm stuck in further research into these personal experiences to find why the leaders rotated as we seen in the graph, because we cannot get direct contact with these members. So we are looking for some other quantitative methods. If you would like to see what we have done, please **DOWNLOAD THE PDF** [here](./main.pdf) and offer us some advice on it.
